# clojure-boids

An implementation of boids in clojure, using openGL.  My first clojure project,
hopefully this will become an experiment in the concurrency features of
clojure, as well as discovering what it's like to work with a clojure project
of a decent size. 

And maybe some pretty graphics too :-)

## Usage

Use `lein run` to launch the project. Only tested on OSX, but it lwjgl for
OpenGL, so hopefully it should just work on Windows, OSX and Linux.
