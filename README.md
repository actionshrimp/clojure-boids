# clojure-boids

An implementation of boids in clojure, using OpenGL.  My first clojure project,
hopefully this will become an experiment in the concurrency features of
clojure, as well as discovering what it's like to work with a clojure project
of a decent size.

And maybe there will be some pretty graphics too :-)

## Usage

Use `lein run` to launch the project. Only tested on OSX and Linux, but it uses
lwjgl for OpenGL, so hopefully it should just work on Windows too.
